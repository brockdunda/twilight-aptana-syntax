# twilight-aptana-syntax theme

Just recently, I noticed that my old favorite IDE (Aptana Studio 3) is no longer being supported as far as I can tell. I can no longer download it to a new machine. Since that was the case, I decided it is time to move to a new IDE and chose atom. Unforunately, I couldn't find a similiar theme that I was using so I decided to create my own.
